//This is where the Mii prefab will be stored. It will be a pre-defined model
//structure that (optionally) takes a MiiDataResource as a constructor input,
//and renders an accurate Mii based on that. If no MiiDataResource is provided, 
//the resulting Mii will be the default red shirt Mii from Mii Maker.

//NOT a node, node is a placeholder. some sort of Node3D is what it will actually be.
